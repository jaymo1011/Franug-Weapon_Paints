Installation:

Upload .cfg file to addons/sourcemod/configs
Upload .smx file from the zip to addons/sourcemod/plugins
Upload .phrases.txt file to addons/sourcemod/translations
Add a entry called "weaponpaints" to addons/sourcemod/configs/databases.cfg
You dont need to upload the .sp file

If you already use a old version. Remove your database content and start since 0


A example of a basic databases.cfg is http://pastebin.com/XqsEjPhS


Cvar (put in server.cfg):

sm_weaponpaints_c4 "1" // Enable or disable that people can apply paints to the C4. 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled
sm_weaponpaints_saytimer "10" // Time in seconds for block that show the plugin commands in chat when someone type a command. -1 = never show the commands in chat
sm_weaponpaints_roundtimer "20" // Time in seconds roundstart for can use the commands for change the paints. -1.0 = always can use the command
sm_weaponpaints_rmenu "1" // Re-open the menu when you select a option. 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled.
sm_weaponpaints_onlyadmin "0" // This feature is only for admins. 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled.
sm_weaponpaints_zombiesv "0" // Enable this for prevent crashes in zombie and 1v1 servers for knifes. 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled.

Recommendations: dont advertise the plugin in sv_tags and use it only for admins
